      <p>Marcus Schaefer is busy with  Build Service, KIWI and SUSE Studio.</p>
      
      <p>Every openSUSE user, that tuned graphic, used SaX2. The xorg.conf created with SaX2 has this line:
        # Contact: Marcus Schaefer , 2005</p>
      
      <p>Of course the sax2 is the best known, or better to say the most popular part of his work, but there is much more. The most recent project is KIWI that allows relative painless creation of distribution images (CD, DVD, USB memory stick, … ), and the KIWI is what powers up the SUSE Studio, powerfull and easy to use image creation service.</p>

      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was born into a family with a close touch to nature in the Alps region town of Isny at Allgäu, in the German state of Württemberg. My father Wolfgang Schäfer is a technician and an example for me from the beginning on. My mother Susanne Schäfer is a sportswoman, she always encouraged me to keep on running. My parents gave me full freedom in my decisions and so I decided to became an assistent in physics before I studied computer science. Sport is an elementary part of my life. I always find freedom, friends and a balance to business in sports. My favourites are beachvolleyball and cycling. March 26th 2008 is the year I became a father which was the biggest change in my life followed by my marriage with my wonderful wife Daniela in 2007. Our son Florian is as sweet as a boy can be and I’m excited to see our young family growing :-)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>I studied computer science at the university of applied sciences in Isny in Allgäu. The atmsphere there was more like in a family and I had the chance to take part in several admin projects which forms the background of my first real use of a computer.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I started using Slackware Linux at home in 1996 even though you first had to compile a kernel with your cdrom driver included to be able to start the installation I found that Linux rocks.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I think it was around 1998 when S.u.S.E. offered me a job as an intern and I started my first opensource project called sax. That was the time when I learned how important it is to have users and people supporting you in your effort.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The openSUSE Build Service relies on a cluster of build nodes which creates the packages from the projects. I have implemented an appliance builder and the PXE infrastructure to easily create and deploy the nodes for building the packages.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>As the name says it’s open and along with Novell’s enterprise strategy it’s important for me to be part of an open community too.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What would be your the most important contribution to the openSUSE project and community, or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I think the fact that SUSE is the only distribution which has a unique and fully functional X configuration utility over the last 10 years is something I’m a bit proud of :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>More often than my wife likes it :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Simply trust the geeko</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I don’t know exactly but I think the expert knowledge at SUSE is somewhat unique and surely underrated</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I hope that the open source community believes in us that the name “open”SUSE really is meant serious and that the name SUSE stands for an open distribution as well as for the base of enterprise products. The opensource community is the most important value an operating system can rely on.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asked you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS.</strong></p>
      
      <p>I always encourage people to use openSUSE because with the distro they also get the expert on their side :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
