      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I grew up in a small military town of Mirnij in the northwestern part of Russia.</p>
      
      <p>After school I went to study “Security of the telecommunications systems” in Saint Petersburg,</p>
      
      <p>but I’ve never been a diligent student and left the University after 3 courses.</p>
      
      <p>After some time, life brought me to Germany, where I found a job in SUSE/Novell, and where I work and to this day.</p>
      
      <p>I play the violin, love European literature and classical music. I’m married to a wonderful woman in world and I have a very smart and sweet son Alex :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>The first computer, which was in my family, was ZX Spectrum. I will never forget the sound of loaded games (software was distributed on audio cassette tapes and loading into memory was a sound (perceived by the human ear), interpreted as a sequence of bytes).</p>
      
      <p>When I was about 8-9, my father bought PC. This PC I used mostly for gaming.</p>
      
      <p>The first programm I wrote in VisualBasic in 15. At the same time, I participated in competitions in programming (mostly pascal).</p>
      
      <p>On the first course at University I started to learn C/C++ and GNU/Linux. It was a great time.</p>
      
      <p>I associate this time not only with the most beautiful city in the world, but also with the start of using the best operating system and such books like</p>
      
      <p>“Just for fun” by Linus Torvalds and “Understanding UNIX/Linux Programming” by Bruce Molay ;)</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I think it was 2006, SUSE Linux 10.0. Before that, I used Mandrake, RedHat and FreeBSD.</p>
      
      <p>Why? It’s always interesting to try something new.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Around the same time I started work for SUSE/Novell.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Well, mainly my contribute focuses on the development and support of the Russian openSUSE community.</p>
      
      <p>I learn a lot in SUSE/Novell and I want to share this.</p>
      
      <p>I’m autor of many different Russian articles about openSUSE project. I wrote (or just translated) many howtos/manuals about, for example,</p>
      
      <p>how to use BuildService, or send bugreport (or why it’s so important), how to help and contribute to openSUSE project.</p>
      
      <p>In Russia we have a lot of SUSE users, but not so many contributers.</p>
      
      <p>I think it’s very important to explain that this is really not so hard to contribute, and everybody can do it.</p>
      
      <p>And of course, as SUSE/Novell employee I work on internal SUSE infrastructure, it’s also testing and a bit packaging.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I just love it :)</p>
      
      <p>It’s great to be part of openSUSE community and I’m proud that I work for SUSE Linux.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Hm.. good question.</p>
      
      <p>I was initiator the creation of:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Russian openSUSE planet: <a href="http://http://planet.opensuse.org/ru">http://planet.opensuse.org/ru</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Russian openSUSE forum: <a href="http://http://forums.opensuse.org/p-russian/">http://forums.opensuse.org/p-russian/</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Russian Linux kernel portal: http://ru.kernelnewbies.org</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>A lot of people meet there every day. They help each other and discuss how to make openSUSE (GNU/Linux) even better.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Most of the time at work and every evenings, I think. Sometimes also on weekends.</p>
      
      <p>For me it’s more than project, it’s more like style of life ;)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Open, Community, Fun</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Documentation. I miss developers documentation. Many projects do not have this, and you should ask every time maintainers/developers or read the code yourself.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>It’s not a big problem, but with good documentation will be easier to start to hack and oS project will get more from the community back, I guess.</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Multimedia support.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>If activity of contributers will stay like today, then… world domination :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Hm, actually it’s depend on situation. There are different arguments for developers and users.</p>
      
      <p>For example, it is difficult to explain to users such things like Free Software and Open Source philosophy, or that he/she can also develop a system that he/she use.</p>
      
      <p>Usually I use such arguments:</p>
      
      <p>For non GNU/Linux users:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Very big friendly community</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>no costs</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>no problems with viruses</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>and yes, most important – GNU/Linux is sexy ;)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For non openSUSE, but GNU/Linux users:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Very easy to build RPM software via OBS</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Very good infrastructure</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Very friendly community</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Most of the SUSE/Novell employees and various community members during FOSDEM2010, Tokamak4, every openSUSE release pary (in Nürnberg) and of course openSUSE Conference 2009/2010.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>In KDE: 5 (include Kickoff) + 7 system tray icons.</p>
      
      <p>In Fluxbox: zero</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Bash? :)</p>
      
      <p>Without vi, osc, rpm, zypper, git, mutt, ssh, tar, cmake… will be really complicated, I guess :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Hmm … what’s about the Open Source Linux Driver Generator (LDG) for all types of devices and with 100% support for their functionality? :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>vi</p>
      
      <p>Just because it’s faster, easy to use and always available.</p>
      
      <p>But of course it’s also question of habits and personal preference.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Neo.</p>
