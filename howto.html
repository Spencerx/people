      This is a description of how to do interviews for the "People of openSUSE"
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a first step you need to decide on a person to be interviewed. Contact
      the person and ask if they are willing to do the interview. Include some
      personal message in the question and also some reasoning why they have
      been chosen. When they agree follow up with sending the questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do the interviews via email using the template shown below. It contains
      a first set of question. Follow up with more questions based on the
      answers you already got to drill down on interesting content. Feel free to
      modify the template where needed.
    </p>

      When you have collected the answers store the file in markdown format
      in the `sources` folder and run the `run_me` script to generate the web
