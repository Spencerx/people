      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was born in Emden at 18 June 1969. After leaving the school in 1990, I join the German Navy. Since 1994 I live in Nordholz near Bremerhaven with my wife and my two children (both girls).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Starting in 1985 with a Commodore 64, used for programming in Basic and Assembler I went on to buy my first x86 PC in 1992. Since then, I learned Pascal and Perl. Atn work, I administrate some Windows and Unix/Linux Server and manage the technical IT-Team.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Round about the year 2000, I bought a PC-Magazin with SuSE 6.4, installed it and used it for some time. Since SuSE 7.3, Linux replaced Windows on my PC, because I was able to configure my system on my own without a mouse. ;)</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>In the year 2004 I joined the PackMan-Team. At this time I was looking for x86_64 RPMs. When I realized that there was nothing available, I rebuilt the PackMan-RPMs for x86_64.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Nowadays I build my own packages for PackMan and OBS. I developed and maintain the PackMan Build Service with Pascal. Sometimes I support people in IRC and ML.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The great community!</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
