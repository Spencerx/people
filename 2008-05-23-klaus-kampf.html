      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I am Klaus Kämpf and I work for Novell as an Architect for Systems Management. I spend 1/3 of my time looking into (new) technology, 1/3 looking into current products and 1/3 into integration challenges in the area of systems management.</p>
      
      <p>I was born in the lower Rhine area before man landed on the moon. Since I joined SUSE, I usually celebrate my birthday together with AJ.</p>
      
      <p>I studied Informatics at the ‘RWTH Aachen’ where I also met my lovely wife. After she was finished with her studies, I followed her to Nuremberg. (It wasn’t SUSE which made me move here. :-) )</p>
      
      <p>We have two sons (5 and almost 3) and no pets (yet).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>I learned how to grab a soldering iron on the right side ( ;-) ) from my father. Electronics was my first hobby and got me exposed to the digital world and computers.  Well, my first ‘computer’ was just a microprocessor, programmed via dip-switches and some LEDs for output. This way, I learned computer technology from the ground up which is still valuable when working on software.</p>
      
      <p>During my time in Aachen I made first contact with C and Unix, sent mail using UUCP, coded Unix device and protocol drivers and played with TCP/IP before the Internet was born.</p>
      
      <p>Most of my coding was open source and I worked on a lot of projects. The internet remembers all this way better than I do.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Spring 1999, I mostly used BSD Unix (SunOS) and RedHat before. It was only after I started working for S.u.S.E. that I started to use world’s best operating system ;-)</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Right from the beginning, luckily it was my job.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Planning, prototyping, coding, bugfixing, reading and writing mails, creating and updating Wiki pages.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Seeing ideas realized.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leading sat-solver from a hackweek project to a distribution feature.
      (See previous answer).</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>During daylight.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Geek my computer !</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Wiki documentation.
      Sorting or tagging documentation, howtos and workarounds by distribution version. Currently you never know if what you’re reading still applies to the version you’re running.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Hopefully more and better online documentation so asking Mr. Google for anything Linux related leads to openSUSE instead of Ubuntu.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I would first ask what she wants to do with the computer and then eventually suggest openSUSE. (I’d rather leave people with Windows so I don’t get asked for support. :-) )</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Too many to list here.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Don’t know. My ‘k’onsole window usually covers it all.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>mutt. It’s worlds best mail client …</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The DWIM-shell and -editor. ;-)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Jed. Because microEmacs, running everywhere, had such a crappy license.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None. Famous persons won’t have time to participate anyways. I prefer the non-famous ones with time for contributions.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Knowing how to use Gimp (or any other drawing/imaging tool) inside out.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Great ! Finally time to get back to all these electronics projects I left in the basement years ago.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>“It’s a hundred and six miles to Chicago, we’ve got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it’s dark, and we’re wearing sunglasses.”</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Star Trek, the original series please.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Thai green curry, Salty Lassi.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Tetris, years ago. Haven’t played computer games since then.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Berlin.
      Have been there often before the Wall fell. Wonder how it looks like today.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Camping with my Family.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Dollars ? Exchange it to Euros immediately. Then I’d be more relaxed to think about what do to with the money.</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Here and now.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Sure, but I keep the laptop running.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>This nice thing about computers is that they have quite accurate clocks one can use to set up a reminder.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Sorry, I usually share code, not pictures. ;-)</p>
      
      <p><strong>You couldn’t live without…</strong></p>
      
      <p>My wife and my kids.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which question was the hardest to answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The last but one.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>KDE or GNOME ?
