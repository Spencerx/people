    <h2>Doing new interviews</h2>
    <p>
      See the page about
      <a href='howto.html'>
        how to do interviews with the People of openSUSE
      </a>
      for some instructions and guide lines for doing interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people we ask are people who are involved in the openSUSE community in
      some way. We are trying to have a diverse selection of people with
      different background and doing different type of work.
