## Profile

![Sascha saigkill Manns](images/sascha_manns.jpg)

Sascha is active in many areas of openSUSE (Marketing, Feature Screening and using Build service for his projects), but he is particularly active in openSUSE Weekly News. More than 1300 articles translated and edited since October 2008th is quite some effort. That alone is deserving attention, but he didn’t stopped there and recently he started a new initiative in cooperation with Radiotux. The plan is to prepare digest of openSUSE Weekly News in German. More about that you can read in his Radiotux blog (it is German) and even more in his Lizards blog

## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

I’m 29 years old, living in Germany, single and I have a budgerigar.
I’m working as a merchant and I love to read books, blogs, everything,  and to write.


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

My computer career starts in the 80’s with a Commodore C64. I have subscribed to a magazine called
“64er” and my first steps in programming were to write the listings from the magazine into the editor.
At that time I tried to write in BASIC and Assembler.

In the beginning with C64 there has no GUI and mouse, but then came GEOS to the C64, and from that time it
was possible to write in WYSIWYG .

In the school we had a computer training classes. We had a 286er with monochrome monitor.
At that time there was no Windows. We had the Word and Excel in a DOS Mode.
At the beginning of 90’s we’ve got a 386er computer with a color monitor and WIN 3.11.
That was a great improvement.

First experience with the network was with my C64 through an acoustic coupler.
We dialed a BBS telephone number (Bulletin Board System) short called  “mailbox”.
In the mailbox it was possible to write emails, or post a message to the public board.
Later we’ve got real modems. My first was a 9000 bps, later on a 28000 bps and then 56000 bps modem.

In the beginning the Internet was great, no Flash or Javascript.
But now….  :-)


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

That was between 2000 and 2004. I bought an old SuSE version (6.X), but for me as Windows user
that was too difficult . I started officially with an Version 8.X.


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

That was last year (2008). I have tested the UNSTABLE tree from KDE and posted bugreports.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

I’m working in the [Marketing Team](http://en.opensuse.org/Marketing_Team), [ openFATE  Screening Team](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenFATE/Screening_team) and creating my[ own packages in the openSUSE Build Service](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/saigkill/).

Last week, I  started a new project. I’ve created a German spoken version of the openSUSE Weekly News.
It is a part of the live broadcast. This week will come the issue #65.


**What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?**

In my eyes openSUSE is the best distribution with optimum of stability and usability.
Then, I have found the great community.


**What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community
or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?**

I think my work in the Marketing Team (Weekly News) and openFATE Screening Team.


**When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?**

Every day, if I have enough time.


**Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!**

Save your data, kill Conficker, use openSUSE.


**What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?**

My hope is, that the openSUSE  Members can send submitrequests ([OBS](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service)) in the openSUSE:Factory tree.


**What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?**

I think we have a good distribution where majority of  needs are fulfilled and that is the reason that many
cities change their infrastructure to openSUSE/SLED.
I hope that more people will become a registered users, and so the community will grow up.


**A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS.
What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?**

I think openSUSE has an good usability, has YaST (great tool).
Everyone can build his own packages in OBS and the openSUSE branding is great.

I have met few people from the openSUSE desk in Frankfurt, but I don’t know their names.


**How many icons are currently on your desktop?**

**What is the application you can’t live without? And why?**
