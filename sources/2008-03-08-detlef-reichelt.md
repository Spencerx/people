## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

I was born in Emden at 18 June 1969. After leaving the school in 1990, I join the German Navy. Since 1994 I live in Nordholz near Bremerhaven with my wife and my two children (both girls).


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

Starting in 1985 with a Commodore 64, used for programming in Basic and Assembler I went on to buy my first x86 PC in 1992. Since then, I learned Pascal and Perl. Atn work, I administrate some Windows and Unix/Linux Server and manage the technical IT-Team.


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

Round about the year 2000, I bought a PC-Magazin with SuSE 6.4, installed it and used it for some time. Since SuSE 7.3, Linux replaced Windows on my PC, because I was able to configure my system on my own without a mouse. ;)


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

In the year 2004 I joined the PackMan-Team. At this time I was looking for x86_64 RPMs. When I realized that there was nothing available, I rebuilt the PackMan-RPMs for x86_64.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

Nowadays I build my own packages for PackMan and OBS. I developed and maintain the PackMan Build Service with Pascal. Sometimes I support people in IRC and ML.
