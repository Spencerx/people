## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

I was born in Wismar. After studying in Rostock for a while I got the offer to work at SuSE and I moved to Nuremberg. So here we are. Best job you can get. Nuremberg just misses the sea. But you can’t have everything.


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

I started with a [KC85/4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC85). I got my own one at home. Used it for playing with my brothers and sisters and a bit basic programming. At some point it broke and as the GDR gone as well it was hard to repair it. So I had a few years without an own computer, but I helped my friends with their PC problems anyway. In 1994 I got my own PC (dx4/100). It got OS/2 on it. But I quickly killed that one for Win95. I tried to install some Slackware version on it but it failed horribly. So I sticked to Windows NT for a while.


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

1997/1998 somewhere around that. A friend at the university gave me his SuSE 5.2 CDs and I tried it. Of course the first install didn’t survived very long. “chmod -R 600 .*” is not a good idea.


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

I don’t think you can really join a community. You grow into it.

When more and more stuff got moved to Linux I started hanging out on some Linux IRC channels in ircnet. Later some OSS project channels got added to the list. And at some point I started packaging stuff I needed for my servers. The first 2 SuSE guys I met on IRC were mmj and daemon. I got invited to join the beta program and later started working directly at SuSE.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

Helping people, especially with packaging and the buildservice. Advocating openSUSE. And [https://users.opensuse.org/](https://users.opensuse.org/).


**What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?**

Fun. And seeing the project evolving and growing.


**What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?**

[http://users.opensuse.org/](http://users.opensuse.org/)


**When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?**

Work time and when work needs to be done.


**Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!**

openSUSE is good for you.


**What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?**

More users could step up and be a real part of the project. Every single hand helps.


**What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?**

New opportunity and new challenges. Growing or shrinking to new platforms. Reaching new user groups.


**A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?**

Basically I would tell them “Give it a try. We are not as hyped as Ubuntu. But a good distro anyway.”


**Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?**

Many people at SUSE. Benji, Francis, Pascal, and many people where I forgot the name.


**How many icons are currently on your desktop?**

None. Pekwm does not have any icons.


**What is the application you can’t live without? And why?**

vim. It is the tool for most of my work.


**Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?**

No need to invent it. But Linux still needs a good filemanager.
Would be basically some porting work.


**Which is your preferred text editor? And why?**

vim. Fast. Configurable. I dont need more.


**Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?**

Can I get 100 active contributors instead of 1 famous person too? :)


**Which computer related skills would you like to have?**

Some language and parser theory.


**The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?**

Reading and sleeping. No internet. No work.


**Which is your favorite movie scene?**

The end of heroes. where you see all the arrows flying towards one man.


**Star Trek or Star Wars?**

Star Trek.


**What is your favorite food and drink?**

Corn flakes with milk without sugar.
Mate tea with mint or earl grey.


**Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?**

I played Tactical Ops from the first public beta until a few months ago.
Nowadays I waste my time with BF2142 and Eve.


**Which city would you like to visit?**

Stockholm, Oslo and maybe Vancouver.


**What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?**

Away from people so I can really chill. No phone. No handy. Nothing.


**Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?**

Building me a small house at the beach and for the rest of it I would sponsor projects I am interested in. (This include openSUSE of course)


**If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?**

Here and now.


**There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?**

Uhm no? :)


**Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?**

Of course. :) Way too many times I guess.


**Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!**

Nothing here.


**You couldn’t live without…**

My family. Music. Internet.


**Which question was the hardest to answer?**

Why a person should pick up openSUSE. I am no salesman.


**What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?**

None. We had enough questions already :p
