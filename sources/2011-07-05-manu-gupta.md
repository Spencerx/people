## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

My name is Manu, I am 21 years old and I live in India. I am currently in my final year of graduation in computer science. My native language is Hindi. During my free time, I participate in openSUSE Project and hang out with friends, watch movies and do other stuff.


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

I started with computers in my 6th standard I believe starting with computer games. I immediately fell in love with them. But as I moved to boarding I had no access to computers until my college.


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

I started using openSUSE around 2 years back. I started to use it out of fascination and to learn about Linux as much as I can. Earlier I used Ubuntu and Fedora too but openSUSE caught my attention. I realized it to be a wonderful operating system that furnished my needs.


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

The same time I started using openSUSE. One prominent reason was to learn Linux. So I joined the community to meet awesome people and learn from them.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

I participate in the openSUSE Project in a lot of ways. I am a part of the marketing team, the news team and also the part of ambassador welcome team in our ambassador programme. With my GSoC Project, I will be working on SaX3 and I hope to do it justice.


**What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?**

The fun element and the awesomest people in the project.


**Tell us about your GSoC project?**

I am working on SaX3, and off course it needs no introduction. I just hope I do justice to it at the end of the coding period.


**When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?**

I usually spend a lot of my free time for openSUSE.


**Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!**

Have a lot of fun :)


**What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?**

We need a tighter integration with media codecs. Rest all works like a charm.


**What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project? And your future at the project?**

openSUSE has got a wonderful future. I don't know about my future at the project but definitely like to keep it the way as it is now.


**A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?**

I will ask them to use it for at least 2 months and explore it and then decide. People want instant results and that is not achievable.


**Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?**

Sankar P, Vincent Untz, Bharath Acaharya, Akhil Ladha and a lot of the people from SUSE / Novell Bangalore (now Bengaluru) office. Off course, there are other like Akash, N B Prashanth and Saurabh Sood who contribute a lot to openSUSE and are my very good friends.


**How many icons are currently on your desktop?**

Well none, because of GNOME 3, otherwise there would have been plenty


**What is the application you can't live without? And why?**

Firefox, I spend a lot of time over the net


**Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?**

A git like filesystem maybe

**What is your favorite food and drink?**

While at home, I enjoy my Momâ€™s cooking ( I make sure I gain a few kgs/pounds ;) ). Otherwise, I love pizzas a lot. I love a lot of coffee and also ice-creams.


**Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?**

Lots and lots of games, the list is endless. Earlier when I was on Windows I remember playing carmaggadon, star gunner, flying tigers, xonix, Halo and others.
