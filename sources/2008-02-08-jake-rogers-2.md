## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

To plagiarize my own site; â€œI am just a guy with a passion for the outdoors, photography, technology, and in general, shiny things with blinking lights.â€ My greatest passion has to be mountain biking, however there are many sources of adrenaline I have yet to explore, so that is subject to change.

I JUST (Feb 5) turned 27, which I am less than stoked about. I am currently located in the foothills of North Carolina, USA, where I work as a web developer and I.T. specialist. I want very badly to travel the world, but do not have the means just yet. Pets? Sure, I love pets…. until they attack!


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

My family got their first computer when I was ~10, I believe it was a 286. A couple of years later I received a 486 DX2 66Mhz Packard Bell as a gift from my grandfather. It was the first computer that I really got to know well. It was certainly the start of my lust for technology.

From there I believe it was largely gaming and a general curiosity about how technology works that motivated me to keep learning more about computers. Currently, I am as passionate as ever about technology and cannot wait to see what the future brings.


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

I began using SuSE Linux just after 9.2 became freely available for download, which was roughly 3 months after it’s official release, almost 4 years ago now.

I had become increasingly annoyed with the amount of time I was spending on defensive measures (anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-rootkit, etc). Furthermore, I was terribly bored by both supporting and more acutely, using Windows. Having tried several flavors of Linux numerous times in the past, I figured it was time to see if I could use a Linux distro as my primary desktop once again.

I went with SuSE on that fateful day only because I had not tried it before and they had just had a release which seemed to have a positive buzz. Everything worked in an intuitive way for me and then I discovered YaST, Quanta, and Amarok. The rest is history.


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

I would say I joined the community within hours of becoming a SuSE user. Having used IRC extensively since I was ~12 or 13 years old, it seemed like the natural place to look for help. In #SuSE I found a great community of people with a wide variety of skills willing to help new users adjust.

Once I had adjusted to SuSE myself, I noticed other users asking the same questions I had just learned the answers to. So… I began helping people where I could, learning more myself as I went.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

After using SuSE as my primary desktop for about a year I began writing some basic how-to articles to help new users adjust, install software, configure various services, etc… I don’t see the need to do this any more with the openSUSE wiki.

I also submit bug reports, help out with web development where I can, and harass the developers.

My main participation in the project consists off supporting users on IRC, and advocating openSUSE usage to anyone that is silly enough to ask me what I think with out a clear exit strategy.


**What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?**

The main reason I participate in project in general would have to be for all the ladies!

But my greatest motivation for participating on IRC, is definitely when I see people I helped as new users, months or even years ago, helping others.


**What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?**

Well based on the feed back I received, I think an article I wrote about using Smart on openSUSE 10.1 to get around the horrific package management issues of yore, was my most helpful single contribution. A few people even told me it kept them from switching distros. Yay!


**When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?**

When I should be working.


**Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!**

Best KDE Distro!


**What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?**

Missing: task-oriented multi-lingual screencasts to demonstrate YaST and KDE desktop usage, web server setup, etc..

Underrated: The ease of use and the awesomeness of YaST. As a new Linux user, YaST is just the best thing ever.


**What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?**

The same thing that I hope it holds for me: wealth, prosperity, and a sporty brunette with a wild streak and a trust fund.


**A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?**

First, I’d tell them the benefits of Linux and its ethos as well as the awesomeness of YaST and openSUSE KDE. Then I’d tell them that for every other distribution/OS they use, the God of their choice and one of mine KICKS a puppy.


**Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?**

None unfortunately, I had so wanted to goto FOSDEM this year but it did not work out. I’m hoping I’ll be able to make it next year instead.


**How many icons are currently on your desktop?**

2, a trash can and a shredder.


**What is the application you can’t live without? And why?**

[Quanta](%E2%80%9Dhttp://quanta.kdewebdev.org/), because I can’t make a living with out it.


**Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?**

Marking menus(ala Alias Wavefront Maya) for Krita! Hard to explain, but roughly:

* whitepaper: http://www.billbuxton.com/MMUserLearn.html
* screenshot: http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7375/keyframejq8.jpg


**Which is your preferred text editor? And why?**

[Quanta](//quanta.kdewebdev.org/), great Qt ui that gets almost 100% out of sight, powerful tools for working with php code, debugger integration, kdesvn integration.


**Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?**

Oprah, whatever that women touches turns to gold.


**Which computer related skills would you like to have?**

C++/Qt Programmer (so I could contribute code to KDE).


**The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?**

I’d feel like it would be a good time for a week long hiking trip or perhaps a very long bike ride.


**Which is your favorite movie scene?**

I gotta go with battle of Helm’s Deep from Lord of the Rings.


**Star Trek or Star Wars?**

If you are going to force me to choose, Star Wars!


**What is your favorite food and drink?**

Donuts and the Blue Raspberry Gatorade.


**Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?**

As a kid I was a big Nintendo fan but once I got a computer there was no going back. Although I’m actually going to buy a Xbox 360 just for Grand Theft Auto 4 (I can’t wait a year for the PC version)!


**Which city would you like to visit?**

Any city that has a fellow openSUSE user to show me all the cool stuff that only locals know about.


**What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?**

On a mountain bike at top speed or taking pictures of nature.


**Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?**

Easy. Travel the world with a close friend, a camera, and a need to experience every sport, hunt, and adrenaline inducing activity known to man! After that, who knows… what’s a stripped down old Soviet Mig run these days?


**If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?**

Sure I could change the course of all mankind, but you’d most likely find me telling past-me about all the opportunities he is missing and the mistakes he is about to make.


**There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?**

No, but I should.


**Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?**

Who says I forgot.


**Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!**

[](http://spinink.net/gallery/view/wallpapers/dualwidescreen/yonalasee-3.jpg.html)

I shoot panoramic photography and make [dual screen wallpapers](http://spinink.net/gallery/view/wallpapers/dualwidescreen) from them.


**You couldn’t live without…**

My mountain bike.


**Which question was the hardest to answer?**

The motto question.


**What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?**

What does your desktop look like?
