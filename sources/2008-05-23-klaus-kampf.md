## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

I am Klaus Kämpf and I work for Novell as an Architect for Systems Management. I spend 1/3 of my time looking into (new) technology, 1/3 looking into current products and 1/3 into integration challenges in the area of systems management.

I was born in the lower Rhine area before man landed on the moon. Since I joined SUSE, I usually celebrate my birthday together with AJ.

I studied Informatics at the ‘RWTH Aachen’ where I also met my lovely wife. After she was finished with her studies, I followed her to Nuremberg. (It wasn’t SUSE which made me move here. :-) )

We have two sons (5 and almost 3) and no pets (yet).


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

I learned how to grab a soldering iron on the right side ( ;-) ) from my father. Electronics was my first hobby and got me exposed to the digital world and computers.  Well, my first ‘computer’ was just a microprocessor, programmed via dip-switches and some LEDs for output. This way, I learned computer technology from the ground up which is still valuable when working on software.

During my time in Aachen I made first contact with C and Unix, sent mail using UUCP, coded Unix device and protocol drivers and played with TCP/IP before the Internet was born.

Most of my coding was open source and I worked on a lot of projects. The internet remembers all this way better than I do.


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

Spring 1999, I mostly used BSD Unix (SunOS) and RedHat before. It was only after I started working for S.u.S.E. that I started to use world’s best operating system ;-)


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

Right from the beginning, luckily it was my job.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

Planning, prototyping, coding, bugfixing, reading and writing mails, creating and updating Wiki pages.


**What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?**

Seeing ideas realized.


**What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?**

Leading sat-solver from a hackweek project to a distribution feature.
(See previous answer).


**When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?**

During daylight.


**Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!**

Geek my computer !


**What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?**

Wiki documentation.
Sorting or tagging documentation, howtos and workarounds by distribution version. Currently you never know if what you’re reading still applies to the version you’re running.


**What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?**

Hopefully more and better online documentation so asking Mr. Google for anything Linux related leads to openSUSE instead of Ubuntu.


**A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?**

I would first ask what she wants to do with the computer and then eventually suggest openSUSE. (I’d rather leave people with Windows so I don’t get asked for support. :-) )


**Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?**

Too many to list here.


**How many icons are currently on your desktop?**

Don’t know. My ‘k’onsole window usually covers it all.


**What is the application you can’t live without? And why?**

mutt. It’s worlds best mail client …


**Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?**

The DWIM-shell and -editor. ;-)


**Which is your preferred text editor? And why?**

Jed. Because microEmacs, running everywhere, had such a crappy license.


**Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?**

None. Famous persons won’t have time to participate anyways. I prefer the non-famous ones with time for contributions.


**Which computer related skills would you like to have?**

Knowing how to use Gimp (or any other drawing/imaging tool) inside out.


**The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?**

Great ! Finally time to get back to all these electronics projects I left in the basement years ago.


**Which is your favorite movie scene?**

“It’s a hundred and six miles to Chicago, we’ve got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it’s dark, and we’re wearing sunglasses.”


**Star Trek or Star Wars?**

Star Trek, the original series please.


**What is your favorite food and drink?**

Thai green curry, Salty Lassi.


**Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?**

Tetris, years ago. Haven’t played computer games since then.


**Which city would you like to visit?**

Berlin.
Have been there often before the Wall fell. Wonder how it looks like today.


**What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?**

Camping with my Family.


**Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?**

Dollars ? Exchange it to Euros immediately. Then I’d be more relaxed to think about what do to with the money.


**If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?**

Here and now.


**There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?**

Sure, but I keep the laptop running.


**Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?**

This nice thing about computers is that they have quite accurate clocks one can use to set up a reminder.


**Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!**

Sorry, I usually share code, not pictures. ;-)


**You couldn’t live without…**

My wife and my kids.


**Which question was the hardest to answer?**

The last but one.


**What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?**

KDE or GNOME ?
Web !
