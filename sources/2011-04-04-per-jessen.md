## Interview

**Please introduce yourself!**

My name is Per Jessen, I’m 46 and I live in Switzerland with my wife and son. I’m Danish and I grew up in Denmark, but left about 20 years ago and have since lived and worked in a number of European countries. Professionally I’m a software engineer, and have spent most of my career working on or with IBM mainframes. I’ve been running my own business since 2004.


**Tell us about the background to your computer use.**

My first encounter with a computer was probably in high-school when I got to play with a 16-bit RC7000 (apparently a Data General Nova under the covers). 32K of core memory, a TTY 33 teletype console with paperpunch, dual 8-inch floppy-drives and three terminals. I wrote a lot of COMAL code for that. A little later I bought my ZX81 and after having studied electronics in the early 1980s I went to work in IT for a Danish bank.


**When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?**

I started with SuSE Linux 4.4.1 in 1996 or thereabouts. I bought the box at the Hugendubel bookstore on Marienplatz in Munich. I don’t remember any particular reason why, maybe I was just being curious.


**When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?**

I don’t remember when I joined, but I think it was quite early. My reason for joining was that openSUSE looked like a concept that could be going places and as openSUSE was my favourite distro anyway, it seemed like a good idea to get more involved.


**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

I report bugs, I test the alphas and betas, occasionally I submit patches, I participate on many of the project mailing lists, I actively try to influence where we’re going, and I’ve recently begun working with the OBS.


**What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?**

Nothing in particular. I’m just being loyal to my favourite distro.


**What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?**

I was quite pleased with myself when I succeeded in upgrading nasm (mostly to incorporate a patch I had submitted to the nasm-project a year ago), but it’s hardly an important contribution.


**When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?**

It varies, mostly during the week.


**Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!**

The green stuff!


**What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?**

I think we need more leadership and better quality control. We have too many changes happening without proper review, consideration and planning.


**What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?**

No idea.


**A person ask you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?**

If someone asks me, it’s because they value my advice. I hope that is enough to convince him or her.


**Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?**

None (as far as I know).


**How many icons are currently on your desktop?**

I don’t know, I don’t really use my desktop much. I have about 35-36 open windows.


**What is the application you can’t live without? And why?**

Openoffice â€“ because I do everything in openoffice. Asterisk – because it runs my office and home telephone system.


**Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?**

A unified communications device for use with DECT, Wifi, GSM etcetera. Anywhere, anytime. In essence, the Star Trek comms-badge.


**Which is your preferred text editor? And why?**

Today it’s kwrite and vi, but I really like(d) IBMs LPEX that was part of VisualAge C++.


**Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?**

No-one.


**Which computer related skills would you like to have?**

I could probably do with acquiring some better perl skills, but it’s not a language I really like working with.


**The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?**

Relax.


**Which is your favorite movie scene?**

From the Australian movie "The Dish" when the local band plays the title-music from "Hawaii Five-O" thinking it is the American national anthem. 


**Star Trek or Star Wars?**

I like both actually.


**What is your favorite food and drink?**

Käsepätzle mit Röstzwiebel. Ittinger Klosterbräu. Erdinger Dunkelweiss


**Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?**

Diablo, Transport Tycoon, Master of Magic.


**Which city would you like to visit?**

I’ve been to many of the world’s big cities, but I’ve never been to China, so perhaps Shanghai or Beijing.


**What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?**

On the beach, in Greece or in Denmark.


**Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?**

Buy a Ferrari.


**If traveling through time was possible. When would we be most likely to meet you?**

I’d like to jump to somewhere 50-100 years from now. I’d like to see what the historians of the (near) future think of our world and our actions today.


**There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?**

No.


**Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?**

Yes.


**Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!**

This is "Tiger", our wild cat taking a nap amongst the raspberries in the very early spring sun.


**You couldn’t live without…**

My family.


**Which question was the hardest to answer?**

The one about the picture I wanted to share.


**What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?**

Q: Do you actively contribute to other open source projects?

A: Yes, over the years, I have contributed to a few projects. In no particular order: dosemu, etherboot, hercules-390 (floating point support), maxdb (porting to linux-390), clamav. Way back in my OS/2 days, I published WFDOS, a utility for running DOS programs within IBM Workframe/2. I needed an assembler back then, and only had Borlands Turbo Assembler, but this was only for DOS.
