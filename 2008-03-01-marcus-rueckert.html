    <div class='interview'>
      
      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was born in Wismar. After studying in Rostock for a while I got the offer to work at SuSE and I moved to Nuremberg. So here we are. Best job you can get. Nuremberg just misses the sea. But you can’t have everything.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>I started with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC85">KC85/4</a>. I got my own one at home. Used it for playing with my brothers and sisters and a bit basic programming. At some point it broke and as the GDR gone as well it was hard to repair it. So I had a few years without an own computer, but I helped my friends with their PC problems anyway. In 1994 I got my own PC (dx4/100). It got OS/2 on it. But I quickly killed that one for Win95. I tried to install some Slackware version on it but it failed horribly. So I sticked to Windows NT for a while.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>1997/1998 somewhere around that. A friend at the university gave me his SuSE 5.2 CDs and I tried it. Of course the first install didn’t survived very long. “chmod -R 600 .*” is not a good idea.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I don’t think you can really join a community. You grow into it.</p>
      
      <p>When more and more stuff got moved to Linux I started hanging out on some Linux IRC channels in ircnet. Later some OSS project channels got added to the list. And at some point I started packaging stuff I needed for my servers. The first 2 SuSE guys I met on IRC were mmj and daemon. I got invited to join the beta program and later started working directly at SuSE.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Helping people, especially with packaging and the buildservice. Advocating openSUSE. And <a href="https://users.opensuse.org/">https://users.opensuse.org/</a>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Fun. And seeing the project evolving and growing.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p><a href="http://users.opensuse.org/">http://users.opensuse.org/</a></p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Work time and when work needs to be done.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>openSUSE is good for you.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>More users could step up and be a real part of the project. Every single hand helps.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>New opportunity and new challenges. Growing or shrinking to new platforms. Reaching new user groups.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Basically I would tell them “Give it a try. We are not as hyped as Ubuntu. But a good distro anyway.”</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Many people at SUSE. Benji, Francis, Pascal, and many people where I forgot the name.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None. Pekwm does not have any icons.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>vim. It is the tool for most of my work.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No need to invent it. But Linux still needs a good filemanager.
      Would be basically some porting work.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>vim. Fast. Configurable. I dont need more.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Can I get 100 active contributors instead of 1 famous person too? :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Some language and parser theory.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Reading and sleeping. No internet. No work.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The end of heroes. where you see all the arrows flying towards one man.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Star Trek.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Corn flakes with milk without sugar.
      Mate tea with mint or earl grey.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I played Tactical Ops from the first public beta until a few months ago.
      Nowadays I waste my time with BF2142 and Eve.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Stockholm, Oslo and maybe Vancouver.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Away from people so I can really chill. No phone. No handy. Nothing.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Building me a small house at the beach and for the rest of it I would sponsor projects I am interested in. (This include openSUSE of course)</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Here and now.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Uhm no? :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Of course. :) Way too many times I guess.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Nothing here.</p>
      
      <p><strong>You couldn’t live without…</strong></p>
      
      <p>My family. Music. Internet.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which question was the hardest to answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Why a person should pick up openSUSE. I am no salesman.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None. We had enough questions already :p</p>
