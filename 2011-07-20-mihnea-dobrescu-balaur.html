      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Hello! My name is Mihnea and I’m a 19 year old student from Bucharest, Romania.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’ve had a computer (not the same one, of course!) since I was very young, something like 5 years old, I think and I’ve always been interested in technology. I went to a computer science/programming oriented high school and now I’ve just finished my first year at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers @ the Polytechnic University of Bucharest. I’ve also taken some various extra-curricular courses, like a Linux one, servers etc. Now I’m taking a Java / OOP course during the summer holiday.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>A few years ago, when I was trying various distributions. I haven’t used only openSUSE since, but it is one of my favourite distros because I feel it is somehow more polished than other distros around.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>About before the GSoC research period started. I was interested to see how the people behind openSUSE are like. Also, I didn’t join before because I felt I was too much of a beginner and that I couldn’t really contribute. Stupid thought, I guess.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’m working on the bug reporting tool for my gsoc project and if I have the chance I try to help people on IRC.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I like the community and the general approach of openSUSE. Oh, and my favourite colour is green! :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about your GSoC project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Oh, it’s awesome. Everything works! How cool is that? :)</p>
      
      <p>My project consists of making a bug reporting tool that can help users submit reports easily. Also, it can help screening teams’ members beacause it also finds maintainers and bugowners.</p>
      
      <p>Its main functionalities are splitted in four categories at the moment:</p>
      
      <pre><code>aid – helps the user to determine which is the 'suspected' package that causes a problem
      gather – scans the system for relevant data to provide in a bug
      report or to someone that helps, via IRC let's say
      query – search the Bugzilla instance for bug reports that fit given
      keywords and sorts them by relevance
      submit – gets input from the user and submits the bug report to Bugzilla
      </code></pre>
      
      <p>Underlying nice stuff:</p>
      
      <pre><code>duplicate search – this feature was very wanted from what I could tell. I managed to implement it using a sorting by relevance of bug reports. From what I could see in the tests I've done, it works great. Also, it supports “excluded words” functionality.
      get assignee + maintainers – I use data from the rpm and then get the relevant information via OBS, using it's python bindings, not the shell tool
      check account – verifies that the user has a valid account and if so, it stores the user's credentials in a hidden file, base64 encrypted and pickled to make them not human readable; if the data is stored, the user isn't prompted again for username &amp; password when interacting with bugzilla
      globbing : when searching for a package, you can also do something like search for ' kde* ' and it will show you what packages match
      searching local rpm database: it also looks in 'provides', not only in 'name'
      </code></pre>
      
      <p>I’ve also implemented some other nice stuff but I don’t want to bore the audience. You can find everything in the repo here: https://github.com/mihneadb/suse_bug_reporter</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>During the day, mostly, but I always check my e-mail on the phone.
      Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</p>
      
      <p>Green, polished, structured.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Some nice auto completion for zypper (I mean, for package names and stuff like that). Also, I feel that sometimes it could use more packages in the repos / in the OBS.
      What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project? And your future at the project?</p>
      
      <p>I hope it grows and it becomes more active (wiki, lizards etc.) . I also hope that you (the community) will like my bug reporting tool and will include it by default in the distro and that I can keep improving on it and maintaining it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’d argue that zypper is a nice tool and that YaST helps a lot in configuring and, basically, taking care of one’s system. Also, the fact that the community is great and the fact that he/she probably won’t experience any trouble in regular day-to-day usage.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None :(.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>About five. Nothing important, just stuff that I’ve downloaded and I wanted to see there in order not to forget about it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’d say my web browser (Google-chrome/chromium). Nowadays, you can have anything if you have a web browser! :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>A functional gnome 3 on ATI cards with fglrx drivers, or a smarter Xfce that remembers the switch kb layout shortcuts after a few restarts.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I got used to vim lately because it’s quick and easy to use, but I wouldn’t say it’s my preferred / favourite text editor.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Oh, I don’t really know, the people I thought of probably don’t use Linux.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’d like to learn AI programming. And I will!</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week, how would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I wouldn’t care that much, I’d do what I usually do in my free time â€“ spend time with my girlfriend, play basketball, go swimming, listem to music, read.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>There are many inspirational ones, but, let me choose a funnier one: Bad Boys 2, Reggie comes to take Marcus’ daughter out on a date. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Y9SQhcIjw</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Definitely Star Wars. I didn’t even see too much of Star Trek.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Dorada en sal and fresh orange juice.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Never had a favourite. I do own a PS3. :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>LA.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Skiing.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Image you would win the GSoC! What would you do? Would you stay with openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’m not sure what the question means. If I win the whole amount of money? I’d go in a vacation and maybe buy a watch and the rest I’d save. Yes, as I said above, I’d like to keep working on my tool.</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’m not sure. I kind of like the present.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside, do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No. It’s safe where I live.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Awesome view! http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/The_Spit_Bruny_Island.jpg</p>
      
      <p><strong>You couldn’t live without…</strong></p>
      
      <p>I guess the question means material stuff? My phone, I’d say.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which question was the hardest to answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Which city I’d like to visit.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I don’t know, the questions above were fine. :) I’d like to thank the openSUSE community for according me the opportunity to work on this project, and also my mentor, Michal Vyskocil for his guidance.</p>
