      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was born in a small German town near Hannover and moved into the Nuremberg area to study Biology. In late 1996 I joined S.u.S.E. as a webmaster and presales consultant. I also did some marketing and product management in the coming years, but my main responsibility always was the SUSE webservers. Shortly after the merger with Novell I joined the documentation team, where my main responsibility lies with the openSUSE documentation. I am married and have three kids, a daughter (3) and her twin brothers (1).</p>
      
      <p>Off work I enjoy bird watching, my fish tanks and plants, riding my motorbike, and reading fantasy and SF. If all this still leaves time, I am digitizing my 1000+ punk and alternative rock long-play records and play (offline) role playing computer games.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>My first computer was a Sharp MZ731 with a 4 colour ballpen plotter ;-) . I did some very basic Pascal and Basic hacking, but most of the time just played Defender and Chess on it. That was in 1983/1984. I entirely stopped using computers until the early 90s where I wrote a 200+ pages report on a friend’s x86 286 with a 2MB hard drive using emTeX under DOS. My first real personal computer was a P60 (suffering from the famous Pentium bug). After a year playing with Windows 3.11, I installed S.u.S.E. Linux.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>My first SUSE version was S.u.S.E. Linux 4.2. That was summer 1996. A friend of mine who was working at S.u.S.E. gave it to me because I was so impressed by the virtual desktops when he showed 4.2 to me. I still vividly remember how much I disliked the default SUSE fvwm2 theming, so first thing I tried to do was to change it (I only succeeded after getting a copy of O’Reilly’s “Running Linux”).</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I would say that I joined the community in 1996, because since then I own the SUSE webmaster mail account and therefore have daily contact with SUSE/openSUSE users.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I already mentioned the webmaster@opensuse.org account. Together with Robert also developed and implemented the current openSUSE web skin and helped to develop and set up the Lessons for Lizards (Lfl) project. I regularly do maintenance work on the wiki, too (although I wish I had more time for it).</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Giving my share back to the community who developed the great software I am using daily.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The most important contribution is probably the work on the webmaster mails. The majority of the mails to the webmaster are support questions and I try to help everybody as best as I can. But the contribution I am most proud of is the current openSUSE web skin.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Most of the time at work and sometimes also during the evenings and week-ends.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>“Kraftvoll” – the German word for powerful, which we used quite often in the early days of S.u.S.E.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Nothing openSUSE specific, but sometimes the wheel is reinvented once too often, I think. It’s too often “let’s do the same thing but different” rather than “let’s make this thing better by contributing to it”.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I hope the number of installations will continue to grow, so openSUSE will finally arrive on the desktops. I also wish that the reputation of openSUSE in the overall Linux community will become better, because we deserve it!</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Because openSUSE has got a very dedicated community, the best choice of prebuild software packages and by far the best administration tool.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Too many to list.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Cowsay. Thanks to Paul G. for introducing me to this most useful application at FOSDEM this year.OK, just kidding. I really couldn’t live without amaroK. I couldn’t live without listening to music and once you have used amaroK you definitely don’t want to use any other music player.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>A consistent help system throughout Linux (at least for the GUI part) with useful content. This is one area where Linux is way behind Windows.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>emacs, because it’s the one I am most familiar with. But I also use vi.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>On the one hand I am very curious to get to know what would happen if Bill Gates and Steve Jobs officially would declare their support for openSUSE, on the other hand I wish they will never ever do it. ;-)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Being a real programmer.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week — how would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>It would probably feel very unfamiliar, but I would make use of it and spend time with my wife and kids and go bird watching.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The end of Thelma &amp; Louise. By driving over the cliff, the two keep their recently acquired freedom instead of going into captivity again.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Definitely Star Trek, although I am very fond of Star Wars, too.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Thai Curry and red wine.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Defender on my Sharp MZ731 and nowadays it’s (still) Baldur’s Gate II.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Angkor Watt.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Backpacking holiday.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Someone gives you $1.000.000 — what would you do with the money?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Build or buy a house for my family.</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible — when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Nowhere particular, but I would be very interested in seeing how the landscape looked like before men changed everything.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside — do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Yes, but only once.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!</strong></p>
      
      <p><img src="images/frank_sundermeyer_sharepic.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      
      <p><strong>You couldn’t live without…</strong></p>
      
      <p>Listening to music.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which question was the hardest to answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The next one…</p>
      
      <p><strong>What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>…therefore it’s intentionally left blank ;-) .</p>
