      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>My name is Manu, I am 21 years old and I live in India. I am currently in my final year of graduation in computer science. My native language is Hindi. During my free time, I participate in openSUSE Project and hang out with friends, watch movies and do other stuff.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>I started with computers in my 6th standard I believe starting with computer games. I immediately fell in love with them. But as I moved to boarding I had no access to computers until my college.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I started using openSUSE around 2 years back. I started to use it out of fascination and to learn about Linux as much as I can. Earlier I used Ubuntu and Fedora too but openSUSE caught my attention. I realized it to be a wonderful operating system that furnished my needs.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The same time I started using openSUSE. One prominent reason was to learn Linux. So I joined the community to meet awesome people and learn from them.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I participate in the openSUSE Project in a lot of ways. I am a part of the marketing team, the news team and also the part of ambassador welcome team in our ambassador programme. With my GSoC Project, I will be working on SaX3 and I hope to do it justice.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The fun element and the awesomest people in the project.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about your GSoC project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I am working on SaX3, and off course it needs no introduction. I just hope I do justice to it at the end of the coding period.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I usually spend a lot of my free time for openSUSE.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Have a lot of fun :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>We need a tighter integration with media codecs. Rest all works like a charm.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project? And your future at the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>openSUSE has got a wonderful future. I don’t know about my future at the project but definitely like to keep it the way as it is now.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I will ask them to use it for at least 2 months and explore it and then decide. People want instant results and that is not achievable.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Sankar P, Vincent Untz, Bharath Acaharya, Akhil Ladha and a lot of the people from SUSE / Novell Bangalore (now Bengaluru) office. Off course, there are other like Akash, N B Prashanth and Saurabh Sood who contribute a lot to openSUSE and are my very good friends.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Well none, because of GNOME 3, otherwise there would have been plenty</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Firefox, I spend a lot of time over the net</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>A git like filesystem maybe</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Vim.. as gets the job done</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Linus</p>

      <p>Packaging</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week, how would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I will move out, and read some books, hang out with friends.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Difficult again as I watch a lot of movies and do not remember one specific out of it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Star Wars ( I have not watched Star Trek yet )</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>While at home, I enjoy my Mom’s cooking ( I make sure I gain a few kgs/pounds ;) ). Otherwise, I love pizzas a lot. I love a lot of coffee and also ice-creams.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Lots and lots of games, the list is endless. Earlier when I was on Windows I remember playing carmaggadon, star gunner, flying tigers, xonix, Halo and others. These always remained classic for me even though I enjoyed playing other RPGs and RTS. Nowadays on Linux, I do not play a lot of big games but certainly among my favorites are tux racer, open arena, ardentryst and specially I have no tomatoes are among my favorites</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Again, I am not sure about this there are a lot of places to visit but one of my favorite holiday destinations would be Venice</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I prefer to stay at home as this is my only time when I meet my family.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Image you would win the GSoC! What would you do? Would you stay with openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I don’t know what I am going to with that amount of money not decided yet. Yes I will stay with openSUSE</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I do not prefer time travel :) but maybe this openSUSE Conference if I get to it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside, do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Naa. Why would I do that?</p>
