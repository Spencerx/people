      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>My name is Per Jessen, I’m 46 and I live in Switzerland with my wife and son. I’m Danish and I grew up in Denmark, but left about 20 years ago and have since lived and worked in a number of European countries. Professionally I’m a software engineer, and have spent most of my career working on or with IBM mainframes. I’ve been running my own business since 2004.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>My first encounter with a computer was probably in high-school when I got to play with a 16-bit RC7000 (apparently a Data General Nova under the covers). 32K of core memory, a TTY 33 teletype console with paperpunch, dual 8-inch floppy-drives and three terminals. I wrote a lot of COMAL code for that. A little later I bought my ZX81 and after having studied electronics in the early 1980s I went to work in IT for a Danish bank.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I started with SuSE Linux 4.4.1 in 1996 or thereabouts. I bought the box at the Hugendubel bookstore on Marienplatz in Munich. I don’t remember any particular reason why, maybe I was just being curious.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I don’t remember when I joined, but I think it was quite early. My reason for joining was that openSUSE looked like a concept that could be going places and as openSUSE was my favourite distro anyway, it seemed like a good idea to get more involved.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I report bugs, I test the alphas and betas, occasionally I submit patches, I participate on many of the project mailing lists, I actively try to influence where we’re going, and I’ve recently begun working with the OBS.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Nothing in particular. I’m just being loyal to my favourite distro.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was quite pleased with myself when I succeeded in upgrading nasm (mostly to incorporate a patch I had submitted to the nasm-project a year ago), but it’s hardly an important contribution.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>It varies, mostly during the week.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>The green stuff!</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I think we need more leadership and better quality control. We have too many changes happening without proper review, consideration and planning.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No idea.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person ask you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>If someone asks me, it’s because they value my advice â€“ I hope that is enough to convince him or her.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None (as far as I know).</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I don’t know, I don’t really use my desktop much. I have about 35-36 open windows.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Openoffice â€“ because I do everything in openoffice. Asterisk – because it runs my office and home telephone system.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>A unified communications device for use with DECT, Wifi, GSM etcetera. Anywhere, anytime. In essence, the Star Trek comms-badge.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Today it’s kwrite and vi, but I really like(d) IBMs LPEX that was part of VisualAge C++.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No-one.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I could probably do with acquiring some better perl skills, but it’s not a language I really like working with.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Relax.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>From the Australian movie â€žThe Dishâ€œ when the local band plays the title-music from â€žHawaii Five-Oâ€œ thinking it is the American national anthem.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I like both actually.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>KÃ¤sespÃ¤tzle mit RÃ¶stzwiebel. Ittinger KlosterbrÃ¤u. Erdinger Dunkelweiss.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Diablo, Transport Tycoon, Master of Magic.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’ve been to many of the world’s big cities, but I’ve never been to China, so perhaps Shanghai or Beijing.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>On the beach, in Greece or in Denmark.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Buy a Ferrari.</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible. When would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’d like to jump to somewhere 50-100 years from now â€“ I’d like to see what the historians of the (near) future think of our world and our actions today.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Yes.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!</strong></p>
      
      <p>This is â€žTigerâ€œ, our wild cat taking a nap amongst the raspberries in the very early spring sun.</p>
      
      <p><strong>You couldn’t live without…</strong></p>
      
      <p>My family.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which question was the hardest to answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The one about the picture I wanted to share.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Q: Do you actively contribute to other open source projects?</p>
      
      <p>A: Yes, over the years, I have contributed to a few projects. In no particular order: dosemu, etherboot, hercules-390 (floating point support), maxdb (porting to linux-390), clamav. Way back in my OS/2 days, I published WFDOS, a utility for running DOS programs within IBM Workframe/2. I needed an assembler back then, and only had Borlands Turbo Assembler, but this was only for DOS.</p>
