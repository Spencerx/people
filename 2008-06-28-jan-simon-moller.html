      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’m a student of electrical engineering at Leibniz Universität Hannover. My favourite hobbies beside Linux are amateur-radio/hamradio (callsign dl9pf) and being member of the THW (Federal Agency for Technical Relief). I’m 28 years old.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>My first computer was a C16 with a cassette-tape. It was a funny time in front of the TV and a game of 1500 lines of basic typed-in from a book – pixels of 1cm x 1cm :D . My next station was an Amiga 500 – great games! I still like “Ports of Call” ;) . Next stations were all x86 with DOS, W3.11 and up.</p>
