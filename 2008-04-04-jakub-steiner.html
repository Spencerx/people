      <p>Independently of how many new application features and fixes a distribution release, doesn’t matter much if the distribution doesn’t look great, and users know it for sure!</p>
      
      <p>So, today we are proud to introduce to the world one of the openSUSE UX members team – Jakub Steiner.</p>

      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’m a 33 year old boy, never managed to ‘grow up’. Yet I have a 2 year old daughter.
      I live in the Czech republic.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Since the first time my dad brought a ZX Spectrum home I got hooked. Not exactly sure what was so appealing about them. Perhaps the fact I was never bored. Most versatile toy. I have more gadgets and computers than I can find an actual use for these days.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I first heard about SUSE from a friend. I’m really unsure when this was exactly, 1998 I suppose. I was happy running Redhat at the university, but had a really bad internet connection at home. SUSE came on like 6 CDs (when CD-Rs were pricey and buffer underruns common), essentially shipping every free software package out there, so it did have an appeal.</p>
      
      <p>But I am actually a very fresh SUSEist :-) I only switched to openSUSE on all my boxes at v10.3.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Very late. Since Novell acquired Ximian I have been working on the SLE Cleaning up the rough visual edges.products rather than openSUSE. But SLED isn’t a good choice if you want bleeding edge software. So to be able to keep up with GIMP &amp; Inkscape development, I started running openSUSE. I started doing branding work for it since 10.1 I think. Maybe here and there earlier.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Cleaning up the rough visual edges.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Seeing ugliness. I wish I had a more noble motivation, but since I started using Linux it’s been all about trying to fix things not to look horrible.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Definitely the Tango project. It wasn’t created specifically as a SUSE project, but SUSE has always shipped a wide collection of free software and SUSE users suffered from clashing visual inconsistency. Tango’s main goal is to unify the visual style of application icons.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Luckily I get to work on openSUSE-related things during work hours from time to time. My free time has shrunk to a minimum since I have become the caring father.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Your hardware supported.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Community packaging. We have the excellent Build System, but going to a web page to perform searches is not a good workflow. Zypper might suggest package matches in unsubscribed build system repos when doing searches.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’d like to see openSUSE derived projects that tackle a specific audience/niche. Today you mainly have a big distro trying to address the needs of a home file server, desktop, school workstation or a home theater system at the same time. I would like to see openSUSE as a component platform for people to build a software distribution with a purpose. We have projects like kiwi that allow this to happen.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Well obviously openSUSE looks best. ;)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’ve met a lot of people at GUADEC, FOSDEM, but also visited the Cambridge, Nuremberg and Prague offices a few times. Someone who I have huge respect for is Michael Meeks, who just manages to get so much done wherever he may be.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Around 20 or so. I wish my actual desk was this clean.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Web browser. Love all the new web apps.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I really wish I could manage and edit my home videos effortlessly with free software. It’s such a daunting task.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Vim. It’s everywhere and I got used to it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Famous people isn’t what openSUSE needs. I would like to see young people join openSUSE.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I wish I would remember things. That’s actually something I blame computers for.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The whole Wiik?</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Since I lived in a centrally planned economy I greatly enjoyed Brazil.</p>
      
      <p>Terry Gilliam is really a genius for impressively depicting the tragic and comedy of, say, a plumber (Bob Hoskin’s character, the repairman) having so much impact on your life. This movie is so full of real-life Czechoslovakian absurdity it’s amazing. And of course the secretary’s typewriter transcription of the torture. That movie is just brilliant on so many levels.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Star Trek or Star Wars?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Definitely Red Dwarf.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your favorite food and drink?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Since my espresso machine has been gone for service, I am realizing it’s coffee. I don’t think I have a favorite food. I love too many. One thing that I heard sounds very odd for US folks is a baked rabbit with cream sauce, dumplings and cranberry sauce.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I loved Elevator action on the arcades, Great Escape on the speccy, Enemy Territory on the PC and most recently SSX Blur on the Wii and God of War — Chains of Olympus on the PSP. I like all sorts of games, but I am really impressed what Nintendo managed to do with the Wii.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Tokyo, when I can afford it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?</strong></p>
      
      <p>With a kid, that’s a highly theoretical question. Good food and nice people is what I wish for when going somewhere.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Exchange it to a different currency as fast as possible.</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I very much like it now.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Which one?</p>
      
      <p><strong>Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I am able to forget what I wanted on the way to the kitchen. I will be a serious laugh at 60 if I ever live that long.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!</strong></p>
      
      <p>I share things fairly regularly with people on flickr, twitter, delicious and all the feed planets. But thanks for the offer :)</p>
      
      <p><strong>You couldn’t live without…</strong></p>
      
      <p>My better half &amp; my daughter.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which question was the hardest to answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>This one.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Nah, I think I had enough :-) Thank you.</p>
