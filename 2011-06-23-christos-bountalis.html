      <p>My first Linux distribution was SUSE Linux 6.3. Many years ago, i still remember the nice package with the cds the manuals etc inside. Since then i have used many Linux distro, trying to find the one that suits me best, I have finally found it the last year in openSUSE.
      When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</p>
      
      <p>About three months ago, I joined the openSUSE community.
