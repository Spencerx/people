      <p><strong>Please introduce yourself!</strong></p>
      
      <p>To plagiarize my own site; â€œI am just a guy with a passion for the outdoors, photography, technology, and in general, shiny things with blinking lights.â€ My greatest passion has to be mountain biking, however there are many sources of adrenaline I have yet to explore, so that is subject to change.</p>
      
      <p>I JUST (Feb 5) turned 27, which I am less than stoked about. I am currently located in the foothills of North Carolina, USA, where I work as a web developer and I.T. specialist. I want very badly to travel the world, but do not have the means just yet. Pets? Sure, I love pets…. until they attack!</p>
      
      <p><strong>Tell us about the background to your computer use.</strong></p>
      
      <p>My family got their first computer when I was ~10, I believe it was a 286. A couple of years later I received a 486 DX2 66Mhz Packard Bell as a gift from my grandfather. It was the first computer that I really got to know well. It was certainly the start of my lust for technology.</p>
      
      <p>From there I believe it was largely gaming and a general curiosity about how technology works that motivated me to keep learning more about computers. Currently, I am as passionate as ever about technology and cannot wait to see what the future brings.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I began using SuSE Linux just after 9.2 became freely available for download, which was roughly 3 months after it’s official release, almost 4 years ago now.</p>
      
      <p>I had become increasingly annoyed with the amount of time I was spending on defensive measures (anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-rootkit, etc). Furthermore, I was terribly bored by both supporting and more acutely, using Windows. Having tried several flavors of Linux numerous times in the past, I figured it was time to see if I could use a Linux distro as my primary desktop once again.</p>
      
      <p>I went with SuSE on that fateful day only because I had not tried it before and they had just had a release which seemed to have a positive buzz. Everything worked in an intuitive way for me and then I discovered YaST, Quanta, and Amarok. The rest is history.</p>
      
      <p><strong>When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I would say I joined the community within hours of becoming a SuSE user. Having used IRC extensively since I was ~12 or 13 years old, it seemed like the natural place to look for help. In #SuSE I found a great community of people with a wide variety of skills willing to help new users adjust.</p>
      
      <p>Once I had adjusted to SuSE myself, I noticed other users asking the same questions I had just learned the answers to. So… I began helping people where I could, learning more myself as I went.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>After using SuSE as my primary desktop for about a year I began writing some basic how-to articles to help new users adjust, install software, configure various services, etc… I don’t see the need to do this any more with the openSUSE wiki.</p>
      
      <p>I also submit bug reports, help out with web development where I can, and harass the developers.</p>
      
      <p>My main participation in the project consists off supporting users on IRC, and advocating openSUSE usage to anyone that is silly enough to ask me what I think with out a clear exit strategy.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The main reason I participate in project in general would have to be for all the ladies!</p>
      
      <p>But my greatest motivation for participating on IRC, is definitely when I see people I helped as new users, months or even years ago, helping others.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Well based on the feed back I received, I think an article I wrote about using Smart on openSUSE 10.1 to get around the horrific package management issues of yore, was my most helpful single contribution. A few people even told me it kept them from switching distros. Yay!</p>
      
      <p><strong>When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>When I should be working.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Best KDE Distro!</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Missing: task-oriented multi-lingual screencasts to demonstrate YaST and KDE desktop usage, web server setup, etc..</p>
      
      <p>Underrated: The ease of use and the awesomeness of YaST. As a new Linux user, YaST is just the best thing ever.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?</strong></p>
      
      <p>The same thing that I hope it holds for me: wealth, prosperity, and a sporty brunette with a wild streak and a trust fund.</p>
      
      <p><strong>A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?</strong></p>
      
      <p>First, I’d tell them the benefits of Linux and its ethos as well as the awesomeness of YaST and openSUSE KDE. Then I’d tell them that for every other distribution/OS they use, the God of their choice and one of mine KICKS a puppy.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?</strong></p>
      
      <p>None unfortunately, I had so wanted to goto FOSDEM this year but it did not work out. I’m hoping I’ll be able to make it next year instead.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How many icons are currently on your desktop?</strong></p>
      
      <p>2, a trash can and a shredder.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What is the application you can’t live without? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p><a href="%E2%80%9Dhttp://quanta.kdewebdev.org/">Quanta</a>, because I can’t make a living with out it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Marking menus(ala Alias Wavefront Maya) for Krita! Hard to explain, but roughly:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>whitepaper: http://www.billbuxton.com/MMUserLearn.html</li>
        <li>screenshot: http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7375/keyframejq8.jpg</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your preferred text editor? And why?</strong></p>
      
      <p><a href="//quanta.kdewebdev.org/">Quanta</a>, great Qt ui that gets almost 100% out of sight, powerful tools for working with php code, debugger integration, kdesvn integration.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Oprah, whatever that women touches turns to gold.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which computer related skills would you like to have?</strong></p>
      
      <p>C++/Qt Programmer (so I could contribute code to KDE).</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Internet crashes for a whole week. How would you feel, what would you do?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I’d feel like it would be a good time for a week long hiking trip or perhaps a very long bike ride.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which is your favorite movie scene?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I gotta go with battle of Helm’s Deep from Lord of the Rings.</p>

      <p>Donuts and the Blue Raspberry Gatorade.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?</strong></p>
      
      <p>As a kid I was a big Nintendo fan but once I got a computer there was no going back. Although I’m actually going to buy a Xbox 360 just for Grand Theft Auto 4 (I can’t wait a year for the PC version)!</p>
      
      <p><strong>Which city would you like to visit?</strong></p>

      <p>On a mountain bike at top speed or taking pictures of nature.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Someone gives you $1.000.000. What would you do with the money?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Easy. Travel the world with a close friend, a camera, and a need to experience every sport, hunt, and adrenaline inducing activity known to man! After that, who knows… what’s a stripped down old Soviet Mig run these days?</p>
      
      <p><strong>If traveling through time was possible, when would we be most likely to meet you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Sure I could change the course of all mankind, but you’d most likely find me telling past-me about all the opportunities he is missing and the mistakes he is about to make.</p>
      
      <p><strong>There’s a thunderstorm outside. Do you turn off your computer?</strong></p>
      
      <p>No, but I should.</p>
